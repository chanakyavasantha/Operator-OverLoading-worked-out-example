# Operator-OverLoading-worked-out-example
Q).Consider a class “coordinate” that has two private data members xnum and ynum. 
The data members correspond to points in the positive quadrant of a 2D coordinate space. 
If the user enters a negative value for any point, convert the point into a positive coordinate point (Hint: Negation operator). 
Write a C++ program to get three points from the user and check if the length between the three points constitute a right angle triangle. 
Utilize operator overloading wherever possible (at least four instances). Overloading the negation operator is mandatory.
The program has the following menu
1.Set Point
2.Display Point 
3.Display Length (Note: Calculates the distance between two points and displays the length)
4.Check Right Triangle
5.Exit


In this program 4 operators are overloaded in order to check whether 3 points form a equilateral triangle
Here we have overloaded '+','~','*','-'
